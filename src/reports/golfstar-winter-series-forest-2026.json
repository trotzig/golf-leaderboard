  "body": "Martin Eriksson delivered a masterclass at Empordá Golf Club this week, capturing the GolfStar Winter Series Forest title on the Cutter & Buck tour with a commanding 16-under-par total, four shots clear of the chasing pack.\n\nThe Kårsta Golfklubb professional set the tournament alight from the very first round, carding an extraordinary 62 to seize early control. It was not the only exceptional scorecard of the opening day — Charlie Lindh of Araslöv Golf & Resort fired a superb 63 — but Eriksson's effort proved the spark for a wire-to-wire display of sustained excellence over three rounds in southern Spain.\n\nDavid Lundgren of Kristianstads Golfklubb and Askersund's Oliver Gillberg shared second place at 12 under par, while Lindh and David Nyfjäll of Upsala Golfklubb rounded out the top five at 11 under. Despite their strong efforts, none could mount a serious challenge to the runaway leader.\n\nThe cut fell at one under par, trimming a 138-player field down to 51 competitors for the final round. The demanding threshold underscored the quality of play across the board, but this week ultimately belonged to Eriksson, whose opening fireworks and relentless consistency earned him a thoroughly deserved victory on the Nordic tour.",
