  "body": "Albin Tidén of Romeleåsens Golfklubb delivered a masterclass over three rounds at Empordá Golf Club, posting a 15-under-par total to win the GolfStar Winter Series Dunes by four clear shots. The Swede was in imperious form from start to finish, building a lead that no rival could seriously threaten down the stretch.\n\nFredrik Lindblom and David Lundgren shared second place at 11-under, with Lundgren's spectacular second-round 62 proving the standout individual performance of the week. That blistering effort vaulted Lundgren up the leaderboard, though it ultimately was not enough to catch the runaway leader. Dutch player Thom Hoetmer finished alone in fourth at 10-under, while Charlie Lindh of Araslöv Golf & Resort rounded out the top five at nine-under.\n\nThe cut fell at one-under par, trimming a 137-player field down to 51 for the final round. The demanding Dunes course at Empordá extracted a heavy toll, with more than 60 percent of the field heading home early — a testament to the challenging conditions along Spain's Costa Brava.\n\nFor Tidén, the four-stroke margin underscored his consistency across all three days. While others produced flashes of brilliance, nobody could match his relentless scoring over 54 holes. It was a statement performance that positions him as one to watch as the Cutter & Buck tour season progresses.",
