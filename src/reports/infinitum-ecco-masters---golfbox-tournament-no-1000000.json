  "body": "Martin Leth Simonsen delivered a masterclass at the INFINITUM ECCO Masters, finishing at 23 under par to claim a commanding four-shot victory over Finland's Matias Honkala at Infinitum Golf in Spain. The Aalborg Golf Klub member was in imperious form throughout the three-day event, capping his performance with a breathtaking round of 60 on the final day — a score that left the rest of the field with no answer.\n\nHonkala had set the early tone with a spectacular opening-round 61, signalling his intent from the outset. But while the Finn remained in contention at 19 under par, Simonsen's historic final round proved the decisive blow. Jonas Baumgartner (62) and Jean Bekirian (63) also lit up the opening day with extraordinary scoring, while amateur Lauri Rosendahl fired a brilliant 62 in the final round to underline the quality on show.\n\nA three-way tie for third at 13 under par saw Marcus Svensson, Jerry Ji, and Kasper Nyland share the podium places, ten shots adrift of the champion — highlighting just how far clear the top two pulled from the chasing pack.\n\nThe cut fell at two under par in a competitive field of 153 players, with only 56 advancing to the final round. The INFINITUM ECCO Masters, notably the one-millionth tournament hosted on the GolfBox platform, will be remembered above all for Simonsen's phenomenal closing 60 — a round that turned a tight contest into a coronation.",
