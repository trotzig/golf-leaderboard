  "body": "Martin Leth Simonsen produced a masterclass at Infinitum Golf in Spain, romping to a four-shot victory at the INFINITUM ECCO Masters with a commanding total of 23 under par. The Aalborg Golf Klub member was in imperious form across all three rounds from February 23–25, leaving the rest of the 153-player field trailing in his wake.\n\nFinland's Matias Honkala of Nevas Golf emerged as the closest challenger, finishing at 19 under par in solo second place. While Honkala's score would have been enough to win many tournaments on the Cutter & Buck tour, he simply had no answer for Simonsen's relentless brilliance. A cluster of three players — Marcus Svensson of Halmstad Golfklubb, Jerry Ji, and Kasper Nyland — shared third place at 13 under, a full ten shots behind the champion.\n\nThe cut fell at two under par, with 56 of the 153 starters advancing to the final round. That demanding threshold underlined the quality of the field, though nobody could match the extraordinary standard set by Simonsen at the top of the leaderboard.\n\nThis landmark event — officially GolfBox Tournament no. 1,000,000 — will be remembered for a complete and authoritative display from Simonsen. His wire-to-wire dominance and the considerable gap between himself and the chasing pack mark this as one of the most emphatic performances of the Nordic tour season so far.",
